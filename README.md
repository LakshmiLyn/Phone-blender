# Phone-blender

Our Activity basically deals with the cantilever model which involves the building 
and construction of a Mobile Phoneâ€™s 3D model. Then many operations are performed over it 
using various tools like lighting it, animating it, and syncing it with audio (optional) to create a 
professional advertisement. A motion capturing video is also recorded. The entire process will 
happen in Blender 3.3 and be rendered completely with the brand new EEVEE real-time render 
engine.
